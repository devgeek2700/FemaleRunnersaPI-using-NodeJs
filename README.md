# FemaleRunnersAPI using NodeJs

This API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints, allowing users to retrieve valuable information about female runners, such as their Ranking, Name, Date of Birth, Score and their native country. 

By employing Node.js, I ensured that the API is highly performant, scalable, and easily maintainable. In this API, there are information of 30 female runners in Women's 100m (50m-55m-60m).

I have created a RESTful API using NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose & Postman. 

Using NodeJs and ExpressJs to create Schema, using MongoDB and Mongoose to store the API Data and using Postman to POST, GET, PATCH and DELETE the data.
